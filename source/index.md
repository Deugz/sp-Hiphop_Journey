This is a sketch of our project looks, it needs to be done more professionaly:

- who ? 

You ? We want to keep the complete independance of our project and hence have no money, we are just looking for people that believe in what we do and are willing to help, if you are a graphic designer, contact us :) (link)

**To Do**


- Important paragraph about what I try to achieve:
New way to create and sustain social connections using the internet.
I think a lots of time, effort, and content is given and lost on social media. I would like to create a new web-plateform that promote a different kind of dialogue.

Describe here the scope of the project

**To do**:

- The idea is to keep a discussion channel open between us. I have created one web page for each person present and speaking at the conference (link). I have included your name, the abstract of your talk and the video presentation. If you want this not to appear here, please let me know, and if you want me to add some more informations or content (pictures, links, bio ...) let me know as well. Remember that you can use 3 different methods to interact (explained above). 

- Before to start archiving, one need to **Collect** first. And this is where I need your help, I provide the structure, the frame, but you must contribute to the content. There is a constellation of people embracing The Hiphop vibes and culture in many different ways, and every story must be told to start envisioingn the impact of a social movement.

- Hiphop is performed by underepresented community and some of this practises are marginalised if not criminal (graffity)
This makes it a critical heritage to document and save as well as making this task incredibely difficult.

## Barry

Welcome to the new **Hiphop Living Arxiv** website, it is built with [Sphinx]() and hosted on [Github](). This website is overarching the different sections (top navbar) that represent hiphop, each of them being a dedicated [JupyterBook]() website. 

The aim is for us to work together on the different websites that I am creating, but YOU have the knowledge and experience to discuss.

- I will use the different tools that jupyter book give me to facilitate the communication between us, cf example below:
 


```{admonition} To Do (*by Barry*)

- Give a broad definition of Hiphop. 

To do so I would like to you to sign-up and use 'utterances'. They are the 3 buttons on the top-right corner (once you have created your account, everytime you highlight some text, you will be given the opportunity to annotate).

Please comment the word below to add your definition like I did

- Annotate


```
