For the moment, I have used the [Hiphop archive conference 2023 Abstract Book] to create one profile for each person in it. However, there is some people that where present in person and that don't appear in the programm (ie James Jessop, Jaspal, Elena, Anifa and probably more)!

- Need to chack with Barry and create
