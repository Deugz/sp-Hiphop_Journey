<p>Hiphop Living Arxiv is a project that is in its early stages of development and has been set up by academic Vincent Deguin with the assistance of Hiphop practitioner Barry Watson (Kraze One). The two colleagues became friends while working/studying at the Open University Milton Keynes where they both contributed to several community events centered around local Hiphop culture. Eventually, after several in depth conversations around the emerging links between Hiphop culture and academia, they created an online space to enable them to build on their ideas, giving birth to this website. 
</p>

<p>
The aim is to provide a plateform, resource and reference point for the knowledge that has been and is in the process of being documented by the global hophop community. 
</p>

```{note}


- Important paragraph about what I try to achieve:
New way to create and sustain social connections using the internet.
I think a lots of time, effort, and content is given and lost on social media. I would like to create a new web-plateform that promote a different kind of dialogue.

```{note}

Describe here the scope of the project

**To do**:

- The idea is to keep a discussion channel open between us. I have created one web page for each person present and speaking at the conference (link). I have included your name, the abstract of your talk and the video presentation. If you want this not to appear here, please let me know, and if you want me to add some more informations or content (pictures, links, bio ...) let me know as well. Remember that you can use 3 different methods to interact (explained above). 

- Before to start archiving, one need to **Collect** first. And this is where I need your help, I provide the structure, the frame, but you must contribute to the content. There is a constellation of people embracing The Hiphop vibes and culture in many different ways, and every story must be told to start envisioingn the impact of a social movement.

## Barry

Welcome to the new **Hiphop Living Arxiv** website, it is built with [Sphinx]() and hosted on [Github](). This website is overarching the different sections (top navbar) that represent hiphop, each of them being a dedicated [JupyterBook]() website. 

The aim is for us to work together on the different websites that I am creating, but YOU have the knowledge and experience to discuss.

- I will use the different tools that jupyter book give me to facilitate the communication between us, cf example below:
 


```{admonition} To Do (*by Barry*)

- Give a broad definition of Hiphop. 

To do so I would like to you to sign-up and use 'utterances'. They are the 3 buttons on the top-right corner (once you have created your account, everytime you highlight some text, you will be given the opportunity to annotate).

Please comment the word below to add your definition like I did

- Annotate


```
