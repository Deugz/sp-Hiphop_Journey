- Hiphop is performed by underepresented community and some of this practises are marginalised if not criminal (graffity)
This makes it a critical heritage to document and save as well as making this task incredibely difficult.

## Barry

Welcome to the new **Hiphop Living Arxiv** website, it is built with [Sphinx]() and hosted on [Github](). This website is overarching the different sections (top navbar) that represent hiphop, each of them being a dedicated [JupyterBook]() website. 

The aim is for us to work together on the different websites that I am creating, but YOU have the knowledge and experience to discuss.

- I will use the different tools that jupyter book give me to facilitate the communication between us, cf example below:
 


```{admonition} To Do (*by Barry*)

- Give a broad definition of Hiphop. 

To do so I would like to you to sign-up and use 'utterances'. They are the 3 buttons on the top-right corner (once you have created your account, everytime you highlight some text, you will be given the opportunity to annotate).

Please comment the word below to add your definition like I did

- Annotate


```
